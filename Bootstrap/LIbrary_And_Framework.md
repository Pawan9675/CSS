# Library vs Framework

### **What is a Library?**
A library is a collection of reusable code that performs specific tasks or functions. Instead of writing everything from scratch, developers use libraries to speed up their work by calling pre-written code into their own programs.

- **Control**: You decide how and when to use the library.
- **Flexibility**: You can pick and choose the features you need without adhering to any predefined structure.

### **What is a Framework?**
A framework is a structured platform that combines multiple libraries and enforces rules for building applications. It provides tools, templates, and workflows, ensuring consistency and speeding up development.

- **Control**: The framework takes control and calls your code where necessary.
- **Structure**: You must follow the framework’s conventions, which makes development standardized but less flexible.

### **Key Difference**
- **Library**: You are the chef. You pick the ingredients and decide how to cook.
- **Framework**: It’s like a pre-made meal kit with step-by-step instructions. You follow the framework’s recipe to complete the dish.

### **Analogy**
- **Library**: Think of libraries as buying pre-made spices or sauces. You don’t need to make the spices yourself, but you still create the final dish with your own recipe and cooking style.
- **Framework**: A framework is like a meal prep service that delivers all the ingredients and instructions to cook a specific dish. You don’t get to decide how to cook—it’s all laid out for you.

### **Examples**
- **Library**: Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides utility functions to manipulate arrays, objects, and strings.
- **Framework**: Bootstrap is a framework for designing responsive websites. It includes pre-designed components and a grid system, making it easier to build consistent layouts.

### **When to Use?**
- Use a **library** when you need flexibility and want control over your code.
- Use a **framework** when you want consistency, speed, and a predefined structure for your project.
